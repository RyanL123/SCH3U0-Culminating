        <h1 class="title">Nuclear Reactions</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">What is it?</h2>
        <p>
            Nuclear reactions are reactions that occur when a high energy particle collides with the nucleus of an atom. 
            These particles can be protons, neutrons, alpha particles, photons, or any particle that is 
            able to overcome the <b>strong nuclear force</b>. The strong nuclear force is the force within the nucleus of an atom 
            that holds it together. As the size of the nucleus increases, this force dramatically decreases, which explains 
            why heavier elements are more unstable and are radioactive. With normal chemical reactions, only valence electrons 
            are shared/exchanged, and the nucleus of the atom remains unchanged. On the other hand, nuclear reactions 
            occur at the nucleus, completely changing the properties of both the particles in the reaction. If however, the nucleus remains 
            unchanged after the interaction with another nucleus or particle, then the process is referred to as an <b>elastic collision</b>
            rather than a nuclear reaction.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Different Types of Nuclear Reactions</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main types of nuclear reactions: <b>Fusion</b> and <b>Fission</b>. Fusion reactions are when two or more nuclei 
            are combined to form one or more different nuclei and other particles, producing energy along the way. Fission reactions 
            are the opposite, where the nucleus of an atom is split into lighter nuclei, while producing a high amount of energy and other alpha particles.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Nuclear Fusion</h2>
        <p>
            The most common example of nuclear fusion can be found right here in the solar system. The sun is a gigantic nuclear reactor, 
            undergoing the process of nuclear fusion at this very moment. Stars generate energy by first convert Hydrogen into Helium through 
            nuclear fusion. When a star has depleted its Hydrogen supply, it then converts Helium to heavier elements like Oxygen and Carbon 
            The energy generated by nuclear fusion is what counteracts the star's own gravitational force and keeps it stable. However, when 
            nuclear fusion reaches Iron, the energy generated is no longer higher than the energy it takes to undergo nuclear fusion. After 
            the star depletes its supply of lighter elements, it can no longer produce enough energy to support itself, and it collapses upon 
            itself, causing a <b>supernova</b>.

        <p>
            Although we can't direct harness the power of a star, <b>fusion reactors</b> which are based on this concept are already being developed.
            The idea is to use the energy produced from nuclear fusion to heat water, producing steam which can then be used to generate 
            electricity. This technology is still under development, meaning real world implementation can still be very far down the line.

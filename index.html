                <p>
                    Nuclear reactions are reactions that occur when a high energy particle collides with the nucleus of an atom. 
                    These particles can be protons, neutrons, alpha particles, photons, or any particle that is 
                    able to overcome the <b>strong nuclear force</b>. The strong nuclear force is the force within the nucleus of an atom 
                    that holds it together. As the size of the nucleus increases, this force dramatically decreases, which explains 
                    why heavier elements are more unstable and are radioactive. With normal chemical reactions, only valence electrons 
                    are shared/exchanged, and the nucleus of the atom remains unchanged. On the other hand, nuclear reactions 
                    occur at the nucleus, completely changing the properties of both the particles in the reaction. If however, the nucleus remains 
                    unchanged after the interaction with another nucleus or particle, then the process is referred to as an <b>elastic collision</b>
                    rather than a nuclear reaction.

                <p>
                    There are two main types of nuclear reactions: <b>Fusion</b> and <b>Fission</b>. Fusion reactions are when two or more nuclei 
                    are combined to form one or more different nuclei and other particles, producing energy along the way. Fission reactions 
                    are the opposite, where the nucleus of an atom is split into lighter nuclei, while producing a high amount of energy and other alpha particles.

                <p>
                    The most common example of nuclear fusion can be found right here in the solar system. The sun is a gigantic nuclear reactor, 
                    undergoing the process of nuclear fusion at this very moment. Stars generate energy by first convert Hydrogen into Helium through 
                    nuclear fusion. When a star has depleted its Hydrogen supply, it then converts Helium to heavier elements like Oxygen and Carbon 
                    The energy generated by nuclear fusion is what counteracts the star's own gravitational force and keeps it stable. However, when 
                    nuclear fusion reaches Iron, the energy generated is no longer higher than the energy it takes to undergo nuclear fusion. After 
                    the star depletes its supply of lighter elements, it can no longer produce enough energy to support itself, and it collapses upon 
                    itself, causing a <b>supernova</b>.

                    Although we can't direct harness the power of a star, <b>fusion reactors</b> which are based on this concept are already being developed.
                    The idea is to use the energy produced from nuclear fusion to heat water, producing steam which can then be used to generate 
                    electricity. This technology is still under development, meaning real world implementation can still be very far down the line.

                <p>
                    Unlike nuclear fusion, nuclear fission can be found all around us. There are hundreds of nuclear power plants around the globe, powering 
                    the world around us through nuclear fission. Nuclear power plants generate around 10% of the total power in the world. Nuclear power plants 
                    are a lot more efficient than burning fossil fuel, with the added benefit of releasing less pollution into the environment.

                <p>
                    The way nuclear power plants generate power is by splitting Uranium atoms, specifically <b>Uranium-235</b>. <b>Uranium-235</b> is extracted from 
                    the more common and abundant isotop <b>Uranium-238</b>, which undergoes an enrichment process that produces a lot of nuclear waste. The 
                    <b>Uranium-235</b> then undergoes <b>nuclear fission</b>, which produces enough energy to heat water into steam. The steam is then able to power 
                    turbines that generates electricity.

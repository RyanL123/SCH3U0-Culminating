                    Nuclear reactions are reactions that occur when a high energy particle collides with the nucleus of an atom. 
                    These particles can be protons, neutrons, alpha particles, photons, or any particle that 
                    can overcome the <b>strong nuclear force</b>. The <b>strong nuclear force</b> is the force within the nucleus of an atom 
                    that holds it together. 
                </p>

                <p class="caption">The particle must overcome the strong nuclear force within the nucleus</p>
                <p>    
                    As the size of the nucleus <b>increases</b>, this force dramatically <b>decreases</b>, which explains 
                    why heavier elements are more unstable and are radioactive. With normal chemical reactions, only valence electrons 
                    are shared/exchanged, and the nucleus of the atom remains unchanged. On the other hand, nuclear reactions 
                    occur at the nucleus, completely changing the <b>properties</b> of both the particles in the reaction. If, however, the nucleus remains 
                    unchanged after the interaction with another nucleus or particle, then the process is referred to as an <b>elastic collision</b>
                    rather than a nuclear reaction.

                <p>
                    There are two main types of nuclear reactions: <b>Fusion</b> and <b>Fission</b>. Fusion reactions are when <b>two or more nuclei</b> 
                    are combined to form one or more <b>different nuclei</b> and other particles, producing energy along the way. Fission reactions 
                    are the opposite, where the nucleus of an atom is split into lighter nuclei while producing a high amount of energy and other alpha particles.

                <h2 class="subtitle" id="nuclear-fusion">Nuclear Fusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The most common example of nuclear fusion can be found right here in our solar system. The sun is a gigantic nuclear reactor, 
                    constantly undergoing the process of <b>nuclear fusion</b>. Stars generate energy by first converting <b>Hydrogen</b> into <b>Helium</b> through 
                    <b>nuclear fusion</b>. When a star has depleted its <b>Hydrogen supply</b>, it then converts <b>Helium</b> to heavier elements like <b>Oxygen and Carbon.</b> 
                    The energy generated by nuclear fusion is what counteracts the star's <b>gravitational force</b> and keeps it stable. However, when 
                    nuclear fusion reaches <b>Iron</b>, the energy generated is no longer higher than the energy it takes to undergo nuclear fusion. After 
                    the star depletes its supply of lighter elements, it can no longer produce enough energy to support itself and it collapses upon 
                    itself in a spectacular <b>supernova</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we can't directly harness the power of a star, <b>fusion reactors</b> which are based on this concept are already being developed.
                    The idea is to use the energy produced from nuclear fusion to heat water, producing steam that can then be used to generate 
                    electricity. This technology is still under development, meaning real-world implementation can still be very far down the line.

                <p>
                    Unlike nuclear fusion, <b>nuclear fission</b> can be found all around us. There are hundreds of nuclear power plants around the globe, powering 
                    the world around us through nuclear fission. Nuclear power plants generate around <b>10% of the total power in the world.</b> Nuclear power plants 
                    are a lot more efficient than burning fossil fuel, with the added benefit of releasing less pollution into the environment.

                <p>
                    The way nuclear power plants generate power is by splitting Uranium atoms, specifically <b>Uranium-235</b>. <b>Uranium-235</b> is extracted from 
                    the more common and abundant isotope <b>Uranium-238</b>, which undergoes an enrichment process that produces a lot of nuclear waste. The 
                    <b>Uranium-235</b> then undergoes <b>nuclear fission</b>, which produces enough energy to heat water into steam. The steam is then able to power 
                    turbines that generate electricity.

                    Generally, nuclear power plants are far away from most residential areas and have been extensively tested to prevent failures. 
                    However, long term unprotected exposure to the radiation generated by the reactor can cause considerable harm to a person. <b>Ionizing radiation</b> 
                    is a type of radiation that strips electrons from atoms, thus <b>ionizing</b> them. <b>Unstable isotopes</b> that break down in a 
                    nuclear reactor emit ionizing radiation as they decay. Power plants today are constructed with materials that absorbs the radiation emitted in order 
                    to protect those working in or around it.

                <h2 class="subtitle" id="accidents">Accidents</h2>
                <p>
                    Although a nuclear power plant is designed with safety as the number one priority, accidents do occur. Most notably, the <b>Chernobyl 
                    disaster</b>. In April of 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant located in northern Ukraine suffered a meltdown. To this day, it is still 
                    considered the worst nuclear disaster in history. Ironically, the accident occurred during one of the safety tests on the reactor. The 
                    purpose of the test was to <b>simulate a power outage in order to observe how power could be supplied to the cooling system by the backup generators.</b> 
                    The results, as we know now, were disastrous. After the power of the reactor was lowered, it suddenly dropped again to <b>near-zero levels</b>, 
                    before being restored to its previous levels. By that time, the reactor had reached a highly unstable condition. The cool water, 
                    combined with the extremely hot fuel, started generating an enormous amount of steam, which greatly increased the <b>pressure</b> within the reactor. 
                    As the <b>pressure</b> increased more and more with no ways of relieving it, the reactor exploded. The resulting fire and nuclear material started 
                    a chain reaction, causing many other explosions as well as filling the air with radioactive materials.

                <p>
                    The aftermath of the disaster was even greater than the initial meltdown. Due to radioactive materials being exposed to the atmosphere, 
                    the environment around the reactor was heavily contaminated. Over <b>100,000 people</b> were evacuated in a <b>30 kilometer radius</b> around the site 
                    of the accident. Those who were exposed to a lethal dose of radiation were dead within days or weeks. There was an estimated <b>4000 deaths 
                    caused by radiation-induced cancer.</b> In 1986, the government of Ukraine began building a sarcophagus around the site of the accident to 
                    prevent any further radiation from coming in contact with the atmosphere. Scientists estimate that the area around Chernobyl will not be 
                    habitable for up to another <b>20,000 years</b>.

                    Whether they realize it or not, a lot of people rely on nuclear energy. In 2018, around <b>20% of electricity in the US was generated 
                    by nuclear reactors.</b> And in Europe, nuclear accounted for almost <b>a quarter of the continent's power.</b> Although many 
                    people's lives are dependant on nuclear power plants, no one wants to be near one. The danger of a potential accident occurring at 
                    the power plant is enough to drive most people away from the area. After the <b>Fukushima disaster in 2011</b>, debates 
                    surrounding the safety of nuclear power has once again become relevant. The question of whether society benefits from this newfound 
                    technology can only be answered with the test of time.

                    Using nuclear power over other traditional methods has many benefits. Compared to fossil fuel, it is over <b>8000 times more efficient</b> 
                    in generating power. This means that only a small  fraction of nuclear reactors need to be built to generate the same amount of power as fossil fuel. 
                    In research conducted by NASA, it was found that 
                </p>
                <blockquote cite="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/903/coal-and-gas-are-far-more-harmful-than-nuclear-power/">
                    "Without nuclear power, it will be even harder to mitigate human-caused climate change and air pollution. This is fundamentally because historical 
                    energy production data reveal that if nuclear power never existed, the energy it supplied almost certainly would have been supplied by fossil fuels 
                    instead (overwhelmingly coal), which cause much higher air pollution-related mortality and GHG emissions per unit energy produced."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    It is evident that although nuclear power still generates waste, its byproducts are considerably less than that of burning fossil fuel.

                <p>
                    Unlike fossil fuel, nuclear reactions do not produce CO<sub>2</sub> when operating, but this is only partly true. Because nuclear reactions 
                    consume Uranium, the process of mining this metal still emits CO<sub>2</sub>. The Uranium also still needs to be 
                    transferred to the reactor. Further, there is no efficient way to dispose of the nuclear waste generated by nuclear reactors. 
                    Right now, excess Uranium is buried underground or stored in warehouses in metal containers. This way of storing radioactive waste will not be feasible in the near 
                    future, as Uranium has a half-life of <b>704 million years</b>.

                    Storing nuclear waste is one thing, but safely storing them is another. If an earthquake was to occur near a nuclear waste storage facility, the 
                    results could be catastrophic. The radioactive material could then contaminate nearby bodies of water, destroying any ecosystems that depend 
                    on it. We have to ask ourselves, "Do the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the risks?" and only then can we get the full perspective of 
                    this newly harnessed power.

                    Nuclear reactions are fundamentally different from chemical reactions. Its power, if used properly can lead to endless possibilities. 
                    Humans have come a long way from burning wood to utilizing the power of stars. Nuclear power can propel our understanding

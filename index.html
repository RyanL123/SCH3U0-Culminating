        <h2 class="subtitle">What is it?</h2>
        <p>
            Nuclear reactions are reactions that occur when a high energy particle collides with the nucleus of an atom. 
            These particles can be protons, neutrons, alpha particles, photons, or any particle that is 
            able to overcome the <b>strong nuclear force</b>. The strong nuclear force is the force within the nucleus of an atom 
            that holds it together. As the size of the nucleus increases, this force dramatically decreases, which explains 
            why heavier elements are more unstable and are radioactive. With normal chemical reactions, only valence electrons 
            are shared/exchanged, and the nucleus of the atom remains unchanged. On the other hand, nuclear reactions 
            occur at the nucleus, completely changing the properties of both the particles in the reaction. If however the nucleus remains 
            unchanged after the interation with another nucleus or particle, then the process is refered to as an <b>elastic collision</b>
            rather than a nuclear reaction.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Different Types of Nuclear Reactions</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main types of nuclear reactions, <b>Fusion</b> and <b>Fission</b>. Fusion reactions are when two or more nuclei 
            are combined to form one or more <b>different</b> nuclei and other particles. Fission reactions are the opposite, where the 
            nucleus of an atom decays into different lighter nuclei.
